# Specialized Configuration for Bayer-to-RGB Training
# =============================================================================
#
# This configuration file contains specialized parameters for training models
# that process raw Bayer pattern images (4-channel) and output profiled RGB images.
# It extends the base configuration in train_dc.yaml with specific settings
# optimized for this task.
#
# Usage:
#   This configuration is used by train_dc_bayer2prgb.py to train neural networks
#   that handle the joint demosaicing, denoising, and compression of Bayer images.
#
# Key specializations:
#   - Crop sizes optimized for Bayer pattern processing
#   - Batch sizes balanced for memory efficiency with 4-channel inputs
#   - Specific encoder/decoder architectures designed for Bayer-to-RGB conversion
#   - Gamma22 transfer function appropriate for this color processing pipeline
#
# See also:
#   - train_dc.yaml: Base configuration with additional parameters
#   - train_dc_prgb2prgb.yaml: Alternative configuration for RGB-to-RGB training

# =============================================================================
# Patch and Batch Configuration
# =============================================================================

# Size of image patches used during training (pixels)
# - Smaller than validation/test crops for memory efficiency
# - Must be divisible by 16 for architecture constraints
crop_size: 256

# Size of validation image patches (pixels)
# - Larger than training crops to better evaluate global image quality
val_crop_size: 1024

# Size of test image patches (pixels)
# - Same as validation for consistent evaluation
test_crop_size: 1024

# Number of random crops extracted from each training image
# - Higher values increase training data diversity
# - Lower values reduce memory usage and processing time
num_crops_per_image: 4

# Batch size for clean (ground truth) images
# - Smaller due to higher memory requirements of full-quality images
batch_size_clean: 1

# Batch size for noisy (input) images
# - Larger to provide more diverse noise patterns per batch
batch_size_noisy: 4
