"""
MS-SSIM Score Distribution Histogram Generator for Natural Image Noise Dataset.

This script analyzes the distribution of MS-SSIM (Multi-Scale Structural Similarity) scores
across the Natural Image Noise Dataset (NIND) and generates a publication-ready histogram
figure in TikZ/LaTeX format. The MS-SSIM scores measure the similarity between noisy images
and their corresponding ground truth references, with values ranging from 0 to 1 (higher
values indicate greater similarity).

The script:
1. Loads image quality metrics from the NIND YAML metadata file
2. Filters entries to include only noisy images (where file path â‰  ground truth path)
3. Extracts MS-SSIM scores from the filtered entries
4. Computes a histogram with customizable bin parameters
5. Generates a TikZ (LaTeX) figure of the histogram with a logarithmic y-axis
6. Saves the figure as a standalone .tex file that can be compiled for publication

The resulting histogram provides a visual representation of the distribution of noise levels
in the dataset, which is valuable for:
- Understanding the noise characteristics of the dataset
- Ensuring adequate coverage across different noise levels for training
- Presenting dataset statistics in academic publications

Usage:
    python plot_dataset_msssim_distributionv2.py

Output:
    A LaTeX file containing TikZ code for the histogram figure
