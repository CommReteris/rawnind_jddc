"""
Objective: Convert standalone script to unit test for OpenEXR export with different bit depths, using mocks for hermeticity.
Test Criteria: Mock np.random.random to dummy array; mock raw.hdr_nparray_to_file; call script logic; assert called with expected bit_depth (32/16) and color_profile.
Fulfillment: Ensures OpenEXR export logic works without real file I/O; verifies calls with different bit depths; replaces original script's intent (export dummy image in 32/16 bit) with testable assertions on mock calls.
Components Mocked/Fixtured: patch for np.random.random (return dummy array); patch for raw.hdr_nparray_to_file (mock call tracking); parametrize over bit_depth (16,32).
Reasons for Mocking/Fixturing: Original script performs real file I/O, causing non-hermetic tests; mocks allow consistent assertion on expected arguments (bit_depth, color_profile='lin_rec2020'); ensures test runs without files; fulfills intent (verify export with different precision) in unit test form without overhead or instability.

    """
    Test OpenEXR export with different bit depths using mocks.

    Objective: Verify that OpenEXR export logic correctly handles different bit depths.
    Test criteria: Mocked export function is called with correct bit_depth and color_profile.
    How testing for this criteria fulfills purpose: Ensures bit depth handling works without real file I/O.
    What components are mocked, monkeypatched, or are fixtures: numpy.random.random (return dummy array), raw_processing.hdr_nparray_to_file (track calls).
    The reasons for which the test will be able to fulfill its objective without the real components being mocked/patched/fixtured: Avoids file system dependencies while testing the core export logic with different bit depths.
