"""Lightweight shims for external paired test dataloaders used by integration scripts.

These classes are imported by several test scripts that are intended to be run
manually (guarded by `if __name__ == "__main__":`). To allow pytest collection
without requiring external datasets, we provide minimal, dependencyâ€‘free
implementations exposing the expected API surface.

If you actually want to run these integration scripts, replace these shims with
real implementations that read the external YAML configuration and construct
iterators over the dataset.
