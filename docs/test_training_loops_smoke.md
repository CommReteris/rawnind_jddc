## test_training_loops_contract_lightweight

This test performs a lightweight contract check on the training loops functionality by verifying that the `ImageToImageNNTraining` class can be imported successfully and is indeed a type (class). This smoke test ensures that the basic training infrastructure is available and properly structured, serving as a minimal validation that the training loops API is accessible and correctly defined.
