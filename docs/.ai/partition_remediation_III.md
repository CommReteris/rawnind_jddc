When I said you have to think big picture, i meant you need to stop and think about what your observation about autoencoder not being in the dictionary _means_ in the context of the original assignment (pasted below)., rather than charging off trying to fix an error so a test can run. I'll try and help with what little insight I have - the autoencoder error suggests that a  architecture from the legacy codebase that should have been implemented in the refactored code has not yet been migrated. Taking this one step further, it begs the question as to whether the rest of the architectures from the legacy code have been migrated, or if - like the autoencoder - they too have been neglected. 

Let's investigate this hypothesis and see if we can find evidence to confirm/deny. If confirmed, we should halt our efforts trying to get tests to pass because they _shouldn't_ be passing - instead we should scope out the work to integrate the models from the legacy code into the new structure and proceed with the doing of.

## Task
- Have a look @/docs/.ai/partition_plan.md , especifically focus on lines 177-320. It is clear that the problematic code was not completely rewritten to the refactoring spec, and inline comments to the effect of "this is a simplified spaceholder - real version will be much more complicated" and the like confirm this.
- You will correct these omitions, utilizing PyCharm's advanced python refactoring tools if possible.
- The end result should  be consistent with the objective to minimize package interdependencies and will make use of clean interfaces for cross package communication - however it should not sacrifice any funcitonality that would compromise the ability of the code to fulfill its inferred intent. (except for legacy CLI code - you can sacrifice that all you like)
- You should prefer to remove the legacy CLI whenever, rather than deprecate in place, whenever practicable in order to keep a clean codebase. Use PyCharm's advanced search tools to quickly determine whether something is safe to remove (or if it can easily be made safe to remove)
- You will use strict TDD, and ensure you understand the intent and structure of the codebase, package, class and function that you are working on prior to deciding how to edit it. 
- You will then modify/extend/complete as necessary to use the clean interpackage interfaces, and above all - to realize the intent and vision of the codebase's author (me) as you understand it. 
- You may think laterally, propose alternate approaches, and consider changes elsewhere in the codebase if you believe it will better realize the author's intent and vision.
- Focus on one package at a time, beginning with the training package. Work has already been completed on the Inference package (to our best knowledge)
