Under no circumstances should you simplify or mock away real parts of the pipeline for integration testing. 
The main goal of the task was to replace synthetic data with real data and ensure the pipeline can execute end-to-end with real dependencies.

The issue is that the ImageToImageNN classes are trying to parse command line arguments when initialized. You can see in the error that it's looking for required arguments like --arch, --match_gain, --loss. Take a step back and look at the big picture - you have uncovered an issue in the execution of the refactoring i.e., exactly why we are trying to run this test. 

Have a look @/docs/.ai/partition_plan.md , especifically focus on lines 177-208. It is clear that the problematic code was not completely rewritten to the refactoring spec, and instead was just moved from where it lived to reside in the inference package. You will correct that, utilizing PyCharm's advanced python refactoring tools. The end result should minimize package interdependencies and will make use of clean interfaces for cross package communication (including to the tests you were just working on) - these clean interfaces should completely replace the legacy CLI interfaces, which should be removed/deprecated whenever possible to keep a clean codebase.

You may have to hunt down where missing functions have been incorrectly moved to, and potentially examine previous commits to find code if it is completely missing. 

Focus on one package at a time, beginning with the problematic ImageToImageNN class.
