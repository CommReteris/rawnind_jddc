## Refactoring Progress Summary

I have successfully continued the refactoring process by extracting core training components from the large
`abstract_trainer.py` file and beginning the dataset extraction from `rawds.py`. Here's what has been accomplished:

### ✅ **Completed Tasks:**

1. **Training Package Completion:**
    - **`training_loops.py`** - Extracted all major training classes:
        - `ImageToImageNNTraining` - Base training class with argument parsing, validation, and testing
        - `PRGBImageToImageNNTraining` - RGB-specific training with batch repacking
        - `BayerImageToImageNNTraining` - Bayer pattern training with color processing
        - `DenoiseCompressTraining` - Combined denoising and compression training
        - `DenoiserTraining` - Pure denoising model training
    - **`experiment_manager.py`** - Experiment management utilities for model cleanup and iteration tracking

2. **Dataset Package Initiation:**
    - **`base_dataset.py`** - Created with core dataset functionality:
        - `RawImageDataset` - Base class for patch-based datasets
        - `RawDatasetOutput` - TypedDict for dataset output format
        - Core cropping utilities (`random_crops`, `center_crop`, `make_a_random_crop`)
        - Constants and configuration from the original `rawds.py`

### 🔄 **Key Refactoring Patterns Applied:**

1. **Modular Extraction**: Successfully split the 2497-line `abstract_trainer.py` into focused training components
2. **Class Hierarchy Preservation**: Maintained the inheritance structure while moving classes to appropriate packages
3. **Dependency Management**: Updated imports to use the new package structure
4. **Code Organization**: Applied clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns

### 📋 **Next Steps for Continuation:**

The refactoring is progressing well with the core training functionality now properly modularized. To continue:

1. **Complete Dataset Package**: Extract remaining dataset classes from `rawds.py` (1704 lines):
    - `CleanCleanImageDataset`, `CleanNoisyDataset`, `TestDataLoader`
    - Specific dataset implementations (`CleanProfiledRGB*`, etc.)
    - Validation and test dataset classes

2. **Reorganize Tools**: Move inference-related tools to the dedicated inference package:
    - `denoise_image.py` → `image_denoiser.py`
    - `simple_denoiser.py` → `simple_denoiser.py`
    - `test_all_known.py` → `batch_inference.py`

3. **Update Imports**: Review and update all existing files to reflect the new package structure

4. **Test Migration**: Relocate and update test files to align with the new structure

### 🎯 **Benefits Achieved So Far:**

- **Reduced Complexity**: Split large monolithic files into manageable, focused modules
- **Improved Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between training, inference, and dataset functionality
- **Better Testability**: Each component can now be tested independently
- **Enhanced Reusability**: Training classes can be used across different contexts
- **Cleaner Dependencies**: Explicit package boundaries make dependencies visible and manageable

### 📊 **Current Status:**

- **Training Package**: ✅ Complete (all major classes extracted)
- **Inference Package**: ✅ Complete (all components extracted from abstract_trainer.py)
- **Dataset Package**: 🔄 In Progress (base classes created, specific implementations pending)
- **Dependencies Package**: ✅ Complete (shared utilities organized)
- **Tools Reorganization**: ⏳ Pending
- **Import Updates**: ⏳ Pending
- **Test Migration**: ⏳ Pending

The refactoring has made significant progress with the foundational package structure established and core training
functionality successfully extracted. The codebase is now much more modular and maintainable, setting the stage for
completing the dataset extraction and finalizing the reorganization.

Would you like me to continue with extracting the remaining dataset classes from `rawds.py` or focus on another aspect
of the refactoring?
