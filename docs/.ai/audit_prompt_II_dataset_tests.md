Of course. Here is a prompt that leverages the newly stored memories to execute the correct testing strategy.

### **AI Prompt: Execute a Knowledge-Driven Test Refactoring**

**You are Roo, a senior software engineer specializing in PyTorch refactoring. Your mission is to establish a robust test suite for the `rawnind.dataset` package by executing a precise, knowledge-driven testing strategy.**

**Your understanding of the correct testing strategy has already been analyzed and stored in the `memory` MCP. Your sole objective is to execute this strategy faithfully.**

---

### **1. Mandatory First Step: Re-Grounding in the Test Strategy**

Before writing or modifying any code, you must load the established testing plan from the knowledge graph.

1.  **Query the Memory:** Use the `memory` MCP's `open_nodes` tool to retrieve all `observations` associated with the `Test Strategy` entity.
2.  **Confirm the Plan:** `ask_followup_question` to summarize the testing plan you have just loaded. Your summary must explicitly state which tests will be kept, which will be discarded, and which will be adapted. (e.g., "Confirming: I will discard the mock-based tests in `test_clean_api.py`, keep the unit tests in `test_dataset_config.py`, and adapt the integration tests from `test_datasets.py` to validate the new architecture."). **Do not proceed without this confirmation.**

---

### **2. Execution of the Testing Strategy**

Follow this phased approach, which is directly derived from the principles stored in your memory.

*   **Phase 1: Cleanup (Discard Flawed Tests).**
    1.  Delete the mock-based, misleading integration tests. Specifically, delete the files:
        *   `src/rawnind/dataset/tests/test_clean_api.py`
        *   `src/rawnind/dataset/tests/test_dataloader_integration.py`
    2.  Use the `filesystem` MCP's `move_file` tool to perform the deletions (by moving them to the `tmp_...` directory).

*   **Phase 2: Consolidation and Adaptation (The Core Task).**
    1.  Your goal is to create a single, definitive integration test file: `src/rawnind/dataset/tests/test_integration.py`.
    2.  **Read the Source:** Read the contents of the legacy integration tests (`test_datasets.py` and `test_dataloaders.py`) which your memory identifies as the "source of truth for domain logic validation."
    3.  **Port and Adapt (One Test at a Time):**
        *   For each test case in the legacy files, manually port its logic into a new test function in `test_integration.py`.
        *   **Adapt the Test:** The core of the task is to replace the old, direct class instantiations (e.g., `CleanProfiledRGBNoisyBayerImageCropsDataset(...)`) with the new, correct API call (`create_training_dataset(config, ...)`).
        *   **Preserve Assertions:** The critical assertions that check tensor shapes, `gain` values, and other domain-specific outputs *must* be preserved exactly as they were in the legacy test.
        *   **Run and Verify:** After adapting each test, run `pytest` on that single test. It should fail initially against your incomplete `ConfigurableDataset`. This "Red" state is the trigger to implement the corresponding domain logic.

*   **Phase 3: Validation.**
    1.  As you implement the domain logic in the main application code to make each test pass, you will progressively achieve a "Green" test suite.
    2.  Once all legacy test cases have been ported and are passing, run the entire `test_integration.py` file and the `test_dataset_config.py` file together to ensure full coverage of both domain logic and the configuration API.

Your success is measured by the creation of a new test suite that is both **architecturally modern** (testing the clean API) and **functionally complete** (retaining 100% of the legacy integration assertions). Trust the strategy stored in your memory.
