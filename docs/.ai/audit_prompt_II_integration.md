# AI Agent Prompt: Integrate Refactored Packages

You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer specializing in PyTorch refactors. Your task is to integrate the refactored `dataset`, `training`, and `inference` packages, ensuring that they work together seamlessly and that the entire project is in compliance with the project's rules and the overall refactoring vision.

## Context and Vision

**Project Rules (from `.roo/rules/rules.md`):**
*   **General:** Use available tools as described.
*   **Anti-patterns:** Never have more than one implementation of the same/substantially similar thing; never call something by more than one name unless absolutely necessary; never have more than one "sole source of truth" (SOT) for any value. Streamline & cleanup (delete) legacy/duplicate code rather than deprecating in place.
*   **Testing:** Run tests with `python -m pytest` followed by normal arguments; do not generate HTML coverage reports.
*   **MCP Usage:** Prioritize MCP tools first (e.g., pycharm for analysis/refactoring, filesystem for file ops, context7 for PyTorch docs); chain them (e.g., search with pycharm, then edit with filesystem); fallback only if MCP fails.

**Refactoring Vision (from `docs/.ai/partition_plan.md`):** The `dataset`, `training`, and `inference` packages have been refactored to use a unified, configuration-driven approach. The goal of this integration task is to ensure that these packages work together seamlessly, and that the end-to-end pipeline is functional.

## Task Breakdown (Use Strict TDD: Red → Green)

### Exploration Phase (Use Tools Methodically):

1.  **CRITICAL**: For any code exploration, use `codebase_search` FIRST with semantic queries (e.g., "data loading from dataset package" or "model loading from training package") to identify the key integration points between the packages.
2.  Then, use MCP tools: `list_code_definition_names` on `path="src/rawnind/"` to get a high-level overview of the entire project; `get_file_problems` (pycharm) on the key integration files you've identified.
3.  If needed, `read_multiple_files` (filesystem MCP) for up to 20 files to get line-numbered contents of the key integration files.

### Diagnosis and Planning:

1.  Identify violations: Mismatched interfaces, incorrect data formats, broken dependencies, and any remaining anti-patterns.
2.  Use `sequentialthinking` MCP if complex (e.g., `thought: "Analyze data flow from dataset to training; next_thought_needed=true"`).
3.  Plan fixes in `<thinking>` tags: Prioritize fixing the data flow from `dataset` to `training`, then from `training` to `inference`.

### Fix Phase (TDD: Red → Green):

1.  **Red**: Run the full test suite with `execute_command "python -m pytest src/rawnind/ --tb=short"` to establish the initial "Red" state.
2.  **Green**: Fix code:
    *   **Interfaces**: Update the `training` package to consume the `ConfigurableDataset` from the `dataset` package correctly. Update the `inference` package to consume the trained models from the `training` package correctly.
    *   **Data Formats**: Ensure that the data formats are consistent across all three packages.
    *   **Dependencies**: Fix any broken dependencies between the packages.
3.  Re-run pytest after each fix; aim for 100% pass across the entire project.
4.  If blocked: `ask_followup_question` for clarification.

### Validation and Cleanup:

1.  Run the full test suite one last time: `execute_command "python -m pytest src/rawnind/ --tb=short"` (expect all green).
2.  Cleanup: Delete any remaining unused legacy files; reformat the entire project with `reformat_file` (pycharm).
