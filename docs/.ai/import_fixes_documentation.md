# Import Fixes in Tests Directory

## Overview

This document describes the import-related issues that were fixed in the `src/rawnind/tests` directory.

## Issues Identified

Two main import issues were identified:

1. In `__init__.py`, the `__all__` list was using a module object instead of a string name:
   ```python
   # Incorrect
   __all__ = [rawtestlib]
   
   # Corrected
   __all__ = ['rawtestlib']
   ```

2. In test files throughout the directory, `rawtestlib` was being imported directly without proper package qualification:
   ```python
   # Incorrect
   import rawtestlib
   
   # Corrected
   from rawnind.tests import rawtestlib
   ```

## Changes Made

1. Fixed the `__init__.py` file to use a string name in the `__all__` list:
   ```python
   # Before
   __all__ = [rawtestlib]
   
   # After
   __all__ = ['rawtestlib']
   ```

2. Updated the import statements in all test files to use proper package qualification:
   - Modified 29 files in total (2 manually, 27 using a script)
   - Changed `import rawtestlib` to `from rawnind.tests import rawtestlib`

## Implementation Process

1. First identified the issues by examining the `__init__.py` file and reviewing test files.
2. Fixed the `__init__.py` file manually.
3. Fixed two test files manually as a proof of concept:
   - `test_progressive_rawnind_denoise_bayer2prgb.py`
   - `test_progressive_manproc_bostitch_denoise_bayer2prgb.py`
4. Created and ran a PowerShell script (`fix_imports.ps1`) to automatically fix the remaining files:
   ```powershell
   # Results from running the script:
   # Files modified: 27
   # Files already fixed: 2
   # Files without rawtestlib import: 30
   ```

## Benefits of the Fixes

1. **Improved Import Consistency**: All imports now follow the same pattern, making the codebase more consistent.
2. **Better Package Structure**: The code now properly respects Python's package structure.
3. **Reduced Import Errors**: The fixes should eliminate import-related errors that would occur when running tests from different locations.
4. **Easier Module Maintenance**: Using proper package qualification makes it easier to relocate modules in the future if needed.

## Future Recommendations

1. Maintain consistent import practices throughout the codebase
2. Use package-qualified imports (`from package import module`) rather than direct imports
3. Always use string names in `__all__` lists
4. Consider adding automated linting to check for import consistency in CI/CD pipelines
