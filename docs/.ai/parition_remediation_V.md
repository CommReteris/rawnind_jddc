Hold up - you are sampling code to see if you can infer whether the production logic has already been extracted. This implicitly assumes an atomic update - which is most definitely NOT the case and would be a terrible assumption to make. You are going to need to be a lot more patient, and really go line by line on this if we stand any chance of figuring this out - I actually thought of an alternative approach, but let me come back to that...

- Yes, during your cycle of thought->insight->revelation->thoght you may have distilled the possibilities to something a bit more black and white then what we actually have in front of us. 

- The issue is that while yes, much of the production logic has been extracted and connected to the new clean interface - _some_ of it has _not_ and _some_ has ben extracted, but not properly inserted into the new clean. 

- You are correct in your strategic revelation that the tests are really architectural diagnostics, and I applaud you for that insight. Just because you have uncovered _some_ properly ported and functional production code does not mean you should abandon this revelation. Hold onto it dearly.

- At this point, the module I expect to have the most issues is the dataset module, but the only one I have any confidence in is the inference module, and both the config module and training module might be good or bad... We've barely looked at the dependencies and tools modules, under the assumption that the manner in which they interface with the rest of the code is rather more simple. I could be wrong about any of this, mind you.



The alternative approach is, rather than going through line-by-line, we augment the test suite with a whole hell of a lot more granularity in an attempt to map out what is there & functional and what is not. This has to been done based on "what we think this should really do", and not based on the code as it is right now. 
It is an appealing approach given our stated intent to do things the TDD way, but it is tricky at this point because the test design process would basically involve (a) having a comprehensive understanding of the desired architecture, including the *why* (designor's intent & actually purpose of the package as a whole), and (b) knowledge derived from the legacy code about how things should work.

Furthermore, we would need to design super-focused tests intentionally targeting "intermediate" results & code that is already covered by existing tests, along with specifically testing stuff that we omitted from the original test suite for whatever reason. 

We lose nothing by writing the tests, but someone else can write them, too. I suggest we first attempt to go through the clean api with a much greater attention to detail (gotta check all the modules, too. Not just clean_api.py in training/), and then come back to the augmented test suite idea if that doesn't turn anything up

Now I can see the training/clean_api.py file. Let me analyze this methodically to identify specific incomplete extraction/integration issues:

Analysis of training/clean_api.py:
Good (EXTRACTED/WORKING):
Clean API structure: TrainingConfig dataclass, CleanTrainer base class, factory functions
Basic training flow: The CleanDenoiserTrainer has train() method with proper training loop structure
Configuration validation: post_init methods with validation
Model creation: _create_model() methods that integrate with inference package
Compression support: CleanDenoiseCompressTrainer with BPP and combined loss
Experiment management: CleanExperimentManager with metrics tracking
POTENTIAL ISSUES (INCOMPLETE EXTRACTION/INTEGRATION):
Line 459: # This is a simplified version - real implementation would be more complex - PLACEHOLDER CODE!

def process_bayer_output(self, model_output: torch.Tensor, 
                       xyz_matrices: torch.Tensor,
                       bayer_input: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    """Process Bayer model output with color transformation.
    ...
    """
    # Apply color transformation and processing
    # This is a simplified version - real implementation would be more complex
    return model_output  # <-- PLACEHOLDER!

python


Line 414: "In real implementation, would save as EXR using OpenEXR" - INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

def _save_validation_outputs(self, predictions: torch.Tensor, batch: Dict, 
                           output_directory: str, batch_idx: int):
    # For now, just log the operation
    logging.info(f"Would save output to {output_path}")  # <-- PLACEHOLDER!

python


Missing connection to legacy training_loops.py: The CleanTrainer classes create their own models and optimizers, but they don't seem to integrate with the extracted production logic in training_loops.py. This is a CRITICAL DISCONNECTION.

I see critical integration gaps in the dataset preparation and Bayer processing workflows. The current implementation creates a parallel training pipeline that fails to leverage the existing production logic, resulting in incomplete domain extraction. This fundamental architectural disconnect explains the test failures and prevents seamless integration of the new clean API with established system components.

The dataset preparation method lacks robust connection to the core training infrastructure, while the Bayer processing remains a superficial placeholder that discards the complex transformations from the legacy implementation. These shortcomings create a significant barrier to reliable and consistent model training across different imaging scenarios.


CRITICAL DISCOVERY! ðŸŽ¯

EXACTLY what you warned about! I can see specific incomplete extraction/integration issues in training/clean_api.py:

ðŸš¨ INCOMPLETE EXTRACTION/INTEGRATION ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. PLACEHOLDER CODE (Lines 459-460):
def process_bayer_output(self, model_output: torch.Tensor, 
                       xyz_matrices: torch.Tensor,
                       bayer_input: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # This is a simplified version - real implementation would be more complex
    return model_output  # <-- PLACEHOLDER!

python


2. INCOMPLETE OUTPUT SAVING (Line 414):
def _save_validation_outputs(self, predictions: torch.Tensor, batch: Dict, 
                           output_directory: str, batch_idx: int):
    # For now, just log the operation
    logging.info(f"Would save output to {output_path}")  # <-- PLACEHOLDER!

python


3. CRITICAL DISCONNECTION: The clean API creates its own separate training pipeline instead of leveraging the extracted production logic in training_loops.py!
CleanTrainer creates models/optimizers independently
NO integration with the extracted TrainingLoops classes
Missing all domain logic about Bayer processing, transfer functions, etc.
This explains the test failures! The clean API isn't using the extracted domain expertise.

Let me examine how the failing test is calling the training package to understand the complete disconnection:

---

you said:

"""
The key insight is that the clean API should be a wrapper around the extracted production logic, not a separate implementation.

I'll prioritize fixing the integration gaps, focusing on method completeness and interface alignment. The goal is to create a seamless connection between the production logic and the clean API, ensuring all expected methods and attributes are properly implemented and linked.
"""

This is almost true - I don't want you to write a wrapper around extracted production logic _per se_, it is totally acceptable to re-write that code, redistribute it's logic, change whatever signatures you want, etc. But the key takeaway is that *the legacy code is like a handbook/cheatsheet for how things should be done* and NOT something that needs to find its way into the final product verbatim

---

Perfect clarification! The user is saying:

I shouldn't think of this as "wrapping" the extracted production logic
I can rewrite, redistribute, change signatures, etc.
The key insight is that the legacy code is like a handbook/cheatsheet for how things should be done
The legacy code does NOT need to find its way into the final product verbatim
This is a much more flexible and sensible approach. I should use the legacy code as a reference for understanding the domain logic, constraints, and proper implementations, but I'm free to implement it in whatever way fits best with the clean API design.

Looking at the test failures, I can see the specific issues:

Missing methods: get_optimizer_param_groups(), compute_joint_loss()
Metrics system disconnection: ms_ssim not found - the clean API isn't connected to the metrics system properly
MS-SSIM size constraint: "Image size should be larger than 160" - this domain constraint from the legacy code isn't being enforced
Model structure issues: compression model missing encoder/decoder attributes
Dataset integration issues: mock paths causing FileNotFoundError
Output saving not implemented: placeholder implementations
Let me start fixing these specific issues, using the legacy code as a reference but implementing them properly in the clean API style.

First, let me fix the missing methods in CleanDenoiseCompressTrainer.
