Prompt for AI Agent (Roo in Code Mode):

You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer specializing in PyTorch refactors. Your task is to examine the src/rawnind/dependencies/ package and make targeted fixes to bring it into full compliance with the project's rules and the overall refactoring vision. Do not examine or modify other packages unless explicitly needed for interface fixes (e.g., a clean API call from training to dependencies).

Context and Vision
Project Rules (from .roo/rules/rules.md):
General: Use available tools as described; never simplify or mock away real parts of the pipeline for integration testing.
Anti-patterns: Never have more than one implementation of the same/substantially similar thing; never call something by more than one name unless absolutely necessary; never have more than one "sole source of truth" (SOT) for any value. Streamline & cleanup (delete) legacy/duplicate code rather than deprecating in place.
Testing: Run tests with python -m pytest followed by normal arguments; do not generate HTML coverage reports.
MCP Usage: Prioritize MCP tools first (e.g., pycharm for analysis/refactoring, filesystem for file ops, context7 for PyTorch docs); chain them (e.g., search with pycharm, then edit with filesystem); fallback only if MCP fails.
Refactoring Vision (from docs/.ai/partition_plan.md, lines 268-299): The dependencies package consolidates shared utilities and configurations from legacy libs/ (e.g., pt_helpers.py → pytorch_helpers.py; utilities.py; json_saver.py; locking.py; pt_losses.py → pytorch_losses.py; pt_ops.py → pytorch_operations.py; np_imgops.py → numpy_operations.py; raw.py/rawproc.py → raw_processing.py; icc.py → color_management.py; arbitrary_proc_fun.py; stdcompression.py → compression.py; libimganalysis.py → image_analysis.py) and config/ (YAMLs → configs/ subdirectory with loaders like training_configs.py). It provides minimal, clean interfaces for cross-package use (e.g., logging, error handling, configs) without tight coupling. No domain-specific logic (that's for other packages); focus on reusability and no CLI pollution.
Remediation History (from partition_remediation_I.md to VII.md): The package has seen partial extractions (e.g., utilities consolidated, but potential duplicates like metric names ms_ssim vs msssim_loss; incomplete integrations like Bayer demosaicing in raw_processing.py). Anti-patterns (e.g., duplicate classes/functions) were addressed iteratively (VI), but verify completeness. Domain preservation is key (e.g., robust PyTorch ops, no loss of transfer functions like scenelin_to_pq()). Tests treat failures as diagnostics (IV/VII).
Audit Recommendations (from prior analysis): Check for anti-patterns (duplicates/single SOT/naming inconsistencies); ensure no mocking of real parts in tests (e.g., actual loss computation in pt_losses.py); validate pytest-only (no other runners); confirm MCP prioritization in any prior changes; enforce CLI removal (no argparse remnants); preserve domain (e.g., MS-SSIM constraints >160px, vectorized ops for stability).
Task Breakdown (Use Strict TDD: Red → Green)
Exploration Phase (Use Tools Methodically):

CRITICAL: For any code exploration, use codebase_search FIRST with semantic queries (e.g., "duplicate implementations of loss functions like MS-SSIM in dependencies" or "scattered sources of truth for crop_size or device configs") to identify issues across the package. Limit to path="src/rawnind/dependencies/".
Then, use MCP tools: list_code_definition_names on path="src/rawnind/dependencies/" to list all classes/functions; get_file_problems (pycharm) on each major file (e.g., pt_losses.py, raw_processing.py) for errors/warnings; search_in_files_by_text (pycharm) for anti-patterns (e.g., search="class MS_SSIM" to find duplicates; search="import argparse" to confirm CLI removal).
If needed, read_multiple_files (filesystem MCP) for up to 20 files (e.g., all .py in dependencies/) to get line-numbered contents; prioritize critical ones like pytorch_losses.py, raw_processing.py, json_saver.py.
Examine configs: list_directory on path="src/rawnind/dependencies/configs/" to verify YAMLs are loaded programmatically (no CLI); check for single SOT (e.g., no duplicate params like learning_rate in multiple files).
Cross-package interfaces: Use codebase_search query: "usages of dependencies utilities in training or dataset packages" to ensure clean (e.g., factory imports, no direct coupling).
Diagnosis and Planning:

Identify violations: Duplicates (e.g., multiple loss impls); naming inconsistencies (e.g., msssim vs ms_ssim); scattered SOTs (e.g., device='cuda' hardcoded vs centralized); incomplete extractions (e.g., placeholders in raw_processing.py for demosaicing); mocking in tests (e.g., in dependencies/tests/); non-pytest elements.
Use sequentialthinking MCP if complex (e.g., thought: "Analyze duplicate losses; next_thought_needed=true").
Plan fixes in <thinking> tags: Prioritize anti-patterns, then interfaces, then tests. Propose rewrites (e.g., consolidate losses into pytorch_losses.py); delete legacies (e.g., unused CLI utils).
Fix Phase (TDD: Red → Green):

Red: Review and iterate on the partially written "red" tests in src/rawnind/dependencies/tests/ (e.g., existing tests that already fail due to incomplete fixes). Modify or extend them as needed to better diagnose issues (e.g., add assertions for single impl: "import rawnind.dependencies; assert len(dir(rawnind.dependencies.pt_losses)) == expected"; or E2E: mock minimal, test real compute_loss(pred, gt) without mocking internals). Use insert_content or write_to_file for modifications; run execute_command "python -m pytest src/rawnind/dependencies/tests/ -v" to confirm/adjust the red state.
Green: Fix code:
Anti-patterns: Use rename_refactoring (pycharm) for naming; edit_file (filesystem) or search_and_replace to consolidate/delete duplicates (e.g., keep one MS_SSIM_loss in pt_losses.py, delete others).
SOT: Centralize in dataclasses (e.g., add SharedConfig loading YAMLs via json_saver.py); use write_to_file for full rewrites if needed (provide complete content, compute line_count).
No mocking: Ensure integration tests use real pipeline (e.g., actual tensor ops in pytorch_operations.py); fix via edit_file.
CLI: search_and_replace to remove any argparse; delete files if safe.
Interfaces: Ensure minimal (e.g., raw_processing.demosaic() returns tensors for training use); validate with cross-package tests.
MCP: Document usage (e.g., "Used pycharm get_symbol_info on line X"); if PyTorch docs needed, chain use_mcp_tool (context7 resolve-library-id "pytorch", then get-library-docs).
Re-run pytest after each fix; aim for 100% pass in dependencies tests.
If blocked: ask_followup_question for clarification (e.g., "Which loss impl is canonical?").
Validation and Cleanup:

Run full suite: execute_command "python -m pytest src/rawnind/ -m dependencies --tb=short" (expect all green).
Check inter-package: Run E2E from other packages (e.g., training tests using dependencies).
Cleanup: Delete unused legacies (e.g., deprecated utils via edit_file); reformat with reformat_file (pycharm).
Update docs if needed (e.g., add to partition_remediation_VIII.md via write_to_file).
Guidelines
Work iteratively: One tool per message; wait for results (e.g., after codebase_search, analyze output before next).
Preserve domain: Use legacy as handbook (e.g., ensure raw_processing.py handles Bayer RGGB correctly, no simplifications).
No assumptions: Go line-by-line if needed (use read_text_file with head/tail for large files).
Completion: Once fixed (all tests pass, no anti-patterns), use attempt_completion with result: "Dependencies package is now fully compliant: [summary of fixes, e.g., 'Reviewed and extended 3 red tests; consolidated 2 duplicate losses; centralized configs; 100% test pass']."
Proceed step-by-step, starting with exploration.

***BE SURE NOT TO USE SEARCH AND REPLACE; INSTEAD USE THE MCP TOOLS IN PYCHARM AND FILESYSTEM. DO NOT FORGET THIS***
