## TestDatasetConfigurationAndValidation::test_validate_dataset_format

This test validates the dataset format validation utility, ensuring that datasets conform to expected formats and structures. It tests the validation logic that checks dataset integrity and format compliance.

## TestDatasetPreprocessingAndAugmentation::test_bayer_pattern_alignment

This test verifies that Bayer pattern alignment is maintained during image cropping operations. It ensures that the cropping process preserves the necessary Bayer pattern structure required for proper demosaicing and color reconstruction.

## TestDatasetSplitsAndReservedData::test_prepare_dataset_splits

This test validates the automatic dataset splitting functionality, ensuring that datasets can be properly divided into training, validation, and test sets according to specified ratios and requirements.

## TestDatasetValidationAndMetadata::test_dataset_metadata_loading

This test verifies the loading and parsing of dataset metadata, ensuring that metadata files are correctly read and interpreted to provide necessary information about the dataset contents and structure.

## TestDatasetValidationAndMetadata::test_dataset_integrity_validation

This test validates dataset integrity validation functionality, ensuring that datasets are complete and contain all required files and data in the expected format.

## TestDatasetLoadingPerformance::test_lazy_loading_behavior

This test verifies that datasets use lazy loading for memory efficiency, ensuring that data is loaded on-demand rather than all at once, which is crucial for handling large datasets.

## TestDatasetLoadingPerformance::test_multiprocessing_data_loading

This test validates multiprocessing data loading capabilities, ensuring that datasets can efficiently load data using multiple processes for improved performance.

## TestSpecializedDatasetTypes::test_rawnind_academic_dataset

This test verifies the loading of RawNIND academic dataset format, ensuring that the specialized academic dataset format from UCLouvain Dataverse is properly supported.

## TestSpecializedDatasetTypes::test_hdr_dataset_support

This test validates HDR/EXR dataset loading capabilities, ensuring that high dynamic range image formats are properly handled and loaded by the dataset infrastructure.

## TestDatasetFormatConversions::test_color_space_conversion

This test verifies color space conversion utilities, ensuring that images can be properly converted between different color spaces as needed for processing.

## TestDatasetFormatConversions::test_bayer_demosaicing_options

This test validates different Bayer demosaicing options, ensuring that various demosaicing algorithms are available and produce correct results for converting Bayer raw images to RGB.

## TestDatasetErrorHandling::test_missing_data_handling

This test verifies the handling of missing or corrupted data files, ensuring that the dataset loading process gracefully handles incomplete datasets.

## TestDatasetErrorHandling::test_insufficient_valid_pixels_handling

This test validates the handling of crops with insufficient valid pixels, ensuring that only valid regions are used for training and invalid areas are properly masked or excluded.

## TestDatasetStatisticsAndAnalysis::test_dataset_statistics_computation

This test verifies the computation of dataset statistics, ensuring that statistical analysis of dataset contents (like mean, variance, distributions) can be performed accurately.

## TestDatasetStatisticsAndAnalysis::test_noise_level_analysis

This test validates noise level analysis for datasets, ensuring that different noise levels in training data can be properly characterized and analyzed.

## TestRawNINDAcademicDatasetSupport::test_rawnind_dataset_loading

This test verifies loading RawNIND dataset from UCLouvain Dataverse, ensuring that the academic RawNIND dataset format is properly supported and loaded correctly.

## TestRawNINDAcademicDatasetSupport::test_rawnind_test_reserve_handling

This test validates RawNIND test reserve image handling, ensuring that reserved test images are properly excluded from training sets to prevent data leakage.
