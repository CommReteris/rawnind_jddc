## test_infer_tensor_and_batch[(3, 8, 8)]

This parametrized test verifies that the `InferenceEngine` can perform inference on single images with shape (3, 8, 8). It creates a tiny model and inference engine, then runs inference on a random tensor, asserting that the output is a tensor with the expected dimensions (3 channels, 8x8 spatial).

## test_infer_tensor_and_batch[(1, 3, 8, 8)]

This test verifies that the `InferenceEngine` can perform inference on batched inputs with shape (1, 3, 8, 8). It tests batch processing capability, ensuring the engine handles batched tensors correctly and produces outputs with proper dimensions.

## test_infer_output_modes[True]

This test verifies that the `InferenceEngine` can return inference results as a dictionary when `return_dict=True`. It checks that the output is a dictionary containing the expected key "reconstructed_image" with a tensor value, demonstrating the flexible output modes of the inference engine.

## test_infer_output_modes[False]

This test verifies that the `InferenceEngine` can return inference results as a plain tensor when `return_dict=False` (the default). It ensures that the engine can provide outputs in different formats depending on the use case requirements.
