## TestCleanImageProcessingPipelineE2E::test_clean_api_real_model_loading_robustness

This test verifies the robustness of model loading in the clean API, ensuring that models can be loaded reliably from checkpoints and handle various loading scenarios without errors.

## TestCleanImageProcessingPipelineE2E::test_clean_api_architecture_switching

This test validates the ability to switch between different neural network architectures in the clean API, ensuring that the same API can work with different model architectures seamlessly.
